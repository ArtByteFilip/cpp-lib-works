# C++ lib works

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates how to define a function in a header (`.hpp`) file and call it from a main program. The goal is to provide a minimal and clear example of separating declarations and definitions in C++.

## Features

- Basic project structure using `.cpp` and `.hpp` files
- Demonstrates function declaration in a header file
- Demonstrates function definition in a `.cpp` file
- Simple usage from the main function
